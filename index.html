      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I made this website to be my first project in web designing and at the same time to be my online CV. I'm an electronics engineer but I aspire to be a web developer soon.</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I do have the basic know how in programming as we do have subjects on college that taught us the basic C-language. I also used the knowledge in programming when we used it in making Arduino-based prototype projects for our subject requirement. Currently, I self-study to learn how to develop websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>Graphics</h3>
        <p>I can do 2D technical drawings using Autocad for electronic system designs. I'm also knowledgable in using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to edit pictures and making logo designs.</p>

        <h3>Monitoring</h3>
        <p>I can focus and thoroughly check mistakes and errors on data that was given to me. My previous job in broadcasting was to monitor the on-air broadcast so that if there are errors that may happen, we are there to recover and make the continuation of broadcast smooth again. I was also responsible on doing the list of programs, commercials and plugs that will be played everyday so I have to do it carefully and check mistakes as always.</p>
